## List of servers ##

iPediaApplication.hpp
look for serverLocalhost, serverOfficial

## Things to do ##

# BEFORE SHIPPING v1.0
* improve registration process

# POSSIBLY AFTER v1.0
* it would be possible to DOS the server by sending a lot of mal-formatted
  requests (i.e. when server thinks that there's still data to be read from the client)
  We could improve things  by using a timeout (i.e. kill connections after 60 secs
  of inactivity)
* convert tables into a list of things see e.g. "Seattle"
