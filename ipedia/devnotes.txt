## List of servers ##

iPediaApplication.hpp
look for serverLocalhost, serverOfficial

## Things to do ##

# BEFORE SHIPPING v1.0
* add in-program tutorial invoked by "tutorial" link
* retrieve (and show) database last update time

# POSSIBLY AFTER v1.0
* it would be possible to DOS the server by sending a lot of mal-formatted
  requests (i.e. when server thinks that there's still data to be read from the client)
  We could improve things  by using a timeout (i.e. kill connections after 60 secs
  of inactivity)
* convert tables into a list of things see e.g. "Seattle"
* remove {{disambig}} tags (and possible others). First step: get a list of
  all those tags
* display when the database was last updated, possibly in "N days ago" format
  instead of a date
