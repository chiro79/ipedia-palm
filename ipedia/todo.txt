## pressing "center" in text field should launch the search

## Huayan_Jing (linked from Huayan as "scripture of the same name) doesn't
exist. English encyclopedia.

## 1. fix converting/displaying for french and german

## 2. add spanish (?)

## 5. add unit tests for new multi-langual features

## 6. remove timeline in the parser e.g. "List of Federal Presidents of Austria"

## 7. change "trail expired" dialog to "Unregistered version expired. Please
register by purchasing registration code.\nEnter registration code?
Yes/NO". Just like in iPedia/SM

## 8. add text-to-speech functions. The idea would be to either do synthesis
on the device (which will be tricky) or do text-to-speech on the server (see
festival speech synthesis system for links and info related to freely available
text-to-speech systems) and stream them to the client in speex format (speex
is a efficient sound compression for speech).

database (see MainForm::changeDatabase)

## 3.5 when server sends langNotAvailable we need to switch to en (we assume 
that english is always available) and display about
(2004-09-12)
