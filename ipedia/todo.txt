## bug: 5-way left still wraps-around links when at the top

## bug: sometimes rendering of centered text is broken e.g. about page for 
French encyclopedia updated on 4/12/09 has:

   65,167 articles. French encyclo
 nclyclopedia last updated on
      004-12-09

While it should be:

   65,167 articles. French
 encyclopedia last updated
      on 04-12-09

## instead of prev/next buttons, do a popup button showing a history
in a popup list, just like blazer on 650 does it.

## improve the copy to clipboard. Currently the first line (which is what shows 
in the list of memos in memo app) is empty. It should be the title of the article
instead.

Release 1.3

## enable those menu items:
        //MENUITEM "Linked articles" ID linkedArticlesMenuItem        "L"
        //MENUITEM "Linking articles" ID linkingArticlesMenuItem      "I"

Release 1.4

## add rendering display align on both left and right sides

## would be nice to show status display during registration. Currently it's
slightly confusing (no immediate feedback to the user after pressing "Register"
button)

## create and send via e-mail every day access stats. Similar to what InfoMan
does. Total number of requests (random/search/extended search), how many
unique users did queries, terms searched for (can be long)

## Huayan_Jing (linked from Huayan as "scripture of the same name) doesn't
exist. English encyclopedia.

## fix converting/displaying for french and german

## add spanish (?)

## add unit tests for new multi-langual features

## remove timeline in the parser e.g. "List of Federal Presidents of Austria"

## change "trail expired" dialog to "Unregistered version expired. Please
register by purchasing registration code.\nEnter registration code?
Yes/NO". Just like in iPedia/SM

## add text-to-speech functions. The idea would be to either do synthesis
on the device (which will be tricky) or do text-to-speech on the server (see
festival speech synthesis system for links and info related to freely available
text-to-speech systems) and stream them to the client in speex format (speex
is a efficient sound compression for speech).

## don't use mysql for storing article body. implies doing full-text search
using lucene. This is to decrease amount of time taken by the conversion process
as well as use less space on disk.


                DONE

## 3.1 get available langs with first request
## 3.2 store available langs in preferences
## 3.3 store currently selected lang in preferences
## 3.4 ability to choose available lang
(2004-09-11)

## 3.6 make sure it works if we try to change database if we haven't downloaded
list of available langs yet. Currently we just pretend that we only have en
database (see MainForm::changeDatabase)
(2004-09-12)

## 3.5 when server sends langNotAvailable we need to switch to en (we assume 
that english is always available) and display about
(2004-09-12)

## 4. modify manage.py to work with multi-lingual interface
(2004-09-12)

## 3. add full language names to Switch database (e.g. "English (en)", "French (fr)"
etc. instead of just "en", "fr")
(2004-09-12)

## ring focus on the text area should also contain the scrolling bar, not
just the text. That's how InfoMan works and it's better.

## transfering focus to a text field should select the text and retain ring
focus (currently it doesn't have ring focus). This is how other apps on
Treo 650 work.
