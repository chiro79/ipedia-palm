## pressing "center" in text field should launch the search

## Huayan_Jing (linked from Huayan as "scripture of the same name) doesn't
exist. English encyclopedia.

## fix converting/displaying for french and german

## add spanish (?)

## add unit tests for new multi-langual features

## remove timeline in the parser e.g. "List of Federal Presidents of Austria"

## change "trail expired" dialog to "Unregistered version expired. Please
register by purchasing registration code.\nEnter registration code?
Yes/NO". Just like in iPedia/SM

## add text-to-speech functions. The idea would be to either do synthesis
on the device (which will be tricky) or do text-to-speech on the server (see
festival speech synthesis system for links and info related to freely available
text-to-speech systems) and stream them to the client in speex format (speex
is a efficient sound compression for speech).

## don't use mysql for storing article body. implies doing full-text search
using lucene. This is to decrease amount of time taken by the conversion process
as well as use less space on disk.

## create and send via e-mail every day access stats. Similar to what InfoMan
does. Total number of requests (random/search/extended search), how many
unique users did queries, terms searched for (can be long)


                DONE

## 3.1 get available langs with first request
## 3.2 store available langs in preferences
## 3.3 store currently selected lang in preferences
## 3.4 ability to choose available lang
(2004-09-11)

## 3.6 make sure it works if we try to change database if we haven't downloaded
list of available langs yet. Currently we just pretend that we only have en
database (see MainForm::changeDatabase)
(2004-09-12)

## 3.5 when server sends langNotAvailable we need to switch to en (we assume 
that english is always available) and display about
(2004-09-12)

## 4. modify manage.py to work with multi-lingual interface
(2004-09-12)

## 3. add full language names to Switch database (e.g. "English (en)", "French (fr)"
etc. instead of just "en", "fr")
