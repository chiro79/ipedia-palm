## 1. remove timeline in the parser e.g. "List of Federal Presidents of Austria"

## 2. change "trail expired" dialog to "Unregistered version expired. Please
register by purchasing registration code.\nEnter registration code?
Yes/NO". Just like in iPedia/SM

## 3. add menu items:
go/Linked articles
go/Lining articles
go/History (displays prev/next history)

## 4. add "Recent lookups" feature i.e. lookups made by other people. Kind of
spying on what other people are looking at.
